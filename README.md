## Linetrace
Linetrace is inspired by: [inconvergent](https://inconvergent.net/generative/linetrace/), mine is way rougher.
Essentially traces one vertex based line with slight deviation from a 
previously placed line. The slight deviations should create an interesting
pattern once viewed as a whole.

## Perlin Terrain
Generates a random terrain map. Terrain type is determined via Perlin Noise; each value between 0-1 is mapped to values 0-4 which then determine terrain type.
